# Amazon Reimbursement Guide

As an Amazon seller, you have multiple opportunities to file for reimbursement from Amazon, particularly for issues related to Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA). These claims generally stem from inventory problems, shipping discrepancies, customer returns, or Amazon's internal errors and system glitches. Regularly auditing your account and transactions is crucial to recover lost revenue efficiently.

Here is a comprehensive guide to Amazon seller reimbursement claims, combining insights from various sources:

### Grounds for Amazon Seller Reimbursement Claims

Amazon reimbursements are financial compensations provided to sellers when errors occur within the FBA system or Amazon’s processes, leading to lost revenue.

**1. Lost or Damaged Inventory**

These claims arise when inventory is lost or damaged while under Amazon's control, whether in fulfillment centers or during transit.

*   **Reimbursement Grounds:**
    *   Amazon loses your inventory within its fulfillment centers.
    *   Inventory received at a fulfillment center but unaccounted for after 30 days.
    *   Amazon damages your inventory.
    *   Items are lost or damaged during transfers between fulfillment centers.
    *   Items are damaged in Amazon's partnered carrier shipments.
    *   Inventory lost or damaged during inbound shipping to Amazon’s warehouses.
    *   Items shipped to customers are lost during delivery and not returned to your inventory.
    *   Inventory goes into a "stranded state" (not sellable or visible) due to Amazon's internal issues. Lost sales opportunities due to mismanaged stranded inventory may sometimes be reimbursable, though harder to prove.
    *   Amazon destroyed your inventory without your authorization or before return/refund processes were complete.
    *   You requested a disposal, but Amazon lost or sold the unit.
    *   If Amazon damages your inventory in their warehouse (warehouse damage compensation).
*   **Eligibility Criteria:**
    *   The inventory must be registered with Amazon FBA and comply with FBA product and inventory requirements.
    *   The loss or damage must not be due to seller error (e.g., incorrect shipping quantities, items pending disposal at your request, or improper packaging by the seller).
    *   The item must not have been defective before entering Amazon's custody.
    *   Your seller account must be in good standing.
*   **Proof Needed:**
    *   Shipment ID.
    *   FBA shipment report.
    *   Proof of Delivery (POD).
    *   Packing Slip or Carrier Receipt.
    *   Inventory Adjustment Report.
    *   High-quality images of damaged items (if available).
    *   Third-party inspection reports.
    *   Supplier invoices showing acquisition date, quantity, and product names (proof of ownership).
    *   Manufacturing cost breakdown.
    *   Details of damaged units.
    *   Removal order report (for disposal errors).
    *   Warehouse damage reports and proof of item condition before storage.
*   **Time Limits:**
    *   Claims must typically be made within 18 months of the issue.
    *   For lost inventory, initiate within 18 months.
    *   For damaged inventory, 18 months from the date of damage/loss event.
    *   For disposal errors, 18 months.
    *   For manual claims for lost inventory, 60 days from the date of the issue (effective October 23, 2024).
    *   For damaged inventory, claims must be filed within 60 days of the issue (effective October 23, 2024).
    *   For lost-in-transit claims, 15–75 days.
*   **Notes:**
    *   Amazon may automatically reimburse for lost or damaged inventory, but manual audits are often needed. As of November 1, 2024, Amazon proactively reimburses for items reported lost in fulfillment centers, trackable in the Reimbursements Report. However, up to 40% of eligible reimbursements may still require manual claims.
    *   As of March 10, 2025, reimbursements for lost or damaged inventory will be based on the product’s manufacturing cost (excluding shipping, handling, or customs duties). Sellers can provide their own manufacturing cost data, or Amazon will estimate it.

**2. Customer Return Issues**

Errors in processing customer returns can lead to reimbursement opportunities when Amazon mishandles returned items or refunds.

*   **Reimbursement Grounds:**
    *   The customer received a refund but never returned the item.
    *   Returned item is damaged or different from what was sent (aka “customer-damaged” or “wrong item returned”).
    *   Return exceeds the acceptable window (e.g., 30 days).
    *   The item was returned but marked as “non-sellable,” and you believe it's still in sellable condition.
    *   Amazon processed a duplicate refund.
    *   Customer returned item damaged beyond resale and Amazon disposed of it.
    *   Amazon issued a refund to a customer that exceeds the correct amount (incorrect customer refund).
    *   The returned item is not restocked to your sellable inventory.
    *   The returned item is lost during shipping back to Amazon’s warehouse.
    *   A returned item from another customer or seller gets added to your inventory.
    *   You receive damaged or incorrect units that Amazon credits to your account.
    *   Customers return used or fake products instead of your new original inventory (return fraud or abuse). Amazon sometimes reimburses in high-value or egregious cases.
*   **Eligibility Criteria:**
    *   Customer-caused damage generally does not qualify unless Amazon fails to handle the return properly.
    *   Claims for return-related issues must typically be filed within 60–120 days from the return initiation date, depending on the specific issue.
    *   You must provide evidence that the return was processed incorrectly (e.g., not restocked or lost).

    *   For incorrect customer refund, 90 days after refund date.
    *   For customer returns claims, 60–120 days.
    *   Wait 45 days after the return is initiated if the item is not restocked or reimbursed.

**3. Overcharged FBA Fees / Fee Reimbursements & Corrections**

These claims occur when Amazon incorrectly charges fees due to system errors, mismeasurements, or duplicate charges.

*   **Reimbursement Grounds:**
    *   Amazon mismeasured or misweighed your product, leading to higher FBA fees.

**6. Chargebacks & SAFE-T Claims (for FBM & FBA Sellers)**

These apply when customers dispute credit card payments or Amazon issues unfair refunds.

*   **Reimbursement Grounds:**
    *   **Chargebacks (disputed credit card payments):** If Amazon decides in the seller’s favor, or if the bank ruled in the customer's favor for a chargeback, but you believe it was invalid (e.g., customer received item, policy followed).
    *   **SAFE-T Claims (Seller Assurance for Transactions):** Where sellers successfully prove that the buyer or Amazon was at fault in A-to-Z claims. This covers cases where:
        *   A returned item is unsellable, but the seller is not at fault.
        *   A materially different item is returned.
        *   The customer did not return the product.
        *   Amazon incorrectly issued a refund.

    *   Tracking info showing delivery, clear return policy, evidence disputing customer's claim (for chargebacks).
    *   Proof of delivery or product condition (for A-to-Z).

    *   60 days from SAFE-T claim date.

**7. Other Reimbursement Opportunities**

*   **Pricing Errors or System Glitches:** Items sold at a lower price due to Amazon system error or glitch (e.g., automated repricing tools malfunction). Requires detailed evidence, not always honored.
*   **Inventory Reconciliation Discrepancies:** When beginning inventory + shipments – sales ≠ ending inventory. This often uncovers hidden losses or damage by Amazon.
*   **Amazon Errors in Labeling, Barcoding, or Listing:** Amazon mishandles your barcode or labels, leading to misrouting, mislisting, or returns. Item gets attributed to a different seller’s listing.
*   **Multi-Channel Fulfillment (MCF) Errors:** Amazon fulfills orders outside of the Amazon marketplace incorrectly (wrong item, late delivery, damaged). Claim for refund on MCF orders.
*   **Inventory Placement Service Issues:** Amazon charges you incorrectly for splitting shipments.
*   **Reimbursement Errors:** If Amazon reimbursed you incorrectly for a prior reimbursement claim (wrong amount, wrong reason, duplicate).
*   **Gift Wrap/Card Fees:** Charged for gift wrap/card service not requested by customer or not performed.

### How to File a Claim

1.  **Identify the Issue:**
    *   Use Amazon Seller Central reports religiously to spot discrepancies:
        *   Payments > Transaction View.
        *   Reports > Fulfillment.
        *   Inventory Adjustments.
        *   Manage FBA Shipments.
        *   Received Inventory.
        *   Removal Order Detail.
        *   Returns and Reimbursements reports.
        *   FBA Customer Returns report.
        *   Reports > Tax Document Library.
        *   Performance > Customer Concessions > SAFE-T Claims.
        *   Performance > Chargeback Claims.
        *   Check the “Reconcile” tab in the Shipping Workflow’s Summary page in Seller Central to identify shipment discrepancies.
2.  **Gather Evidence:**
    *   Collect all relevant documentation: Order IDs, Shipment IDs, ASINs, Screenshots, Reports, Proof of Delivery (PODs), Photos/Videos. Detailed documentation is critical. Keep proof of ownership (e.g., supplier invoices), proof of delivery (e.g., tracking IDs, Bills of Lading), and product specifications. Document all shipments, including itemized lists and packing slips. Photos/videos of prepped/measured items are highly valuable.
3.  **Submit the Claim:**
    *   Go to Seller Central → Help → “Get Support” → “Selling on Amazon” → “Fulfillment by Amazon”.
    *   Use the FBA Reimbursement Tool or open a case with Seller Support.
    *   For FBA issues, use the "Reconcile" tab in Inventory Adjustments, Received Inventory reports, or the "Get Support" > "FBA Reimbursement" path.
    *   For Fee Errors, use "Get Support" > "Other Issues" > "FBA Fee Reimbursement". You can also request Amazon to re-measure your product if the issue is related to incorrect dimensions (possible once every six months).
    *   For SAFE-T Claims, file via the SAFE-T Claims page.
    *   For Chargebacks, respond directly through the Chargeback Claims page.
    *   For complex cases, open a detailed case via "Get Support," clearly explaining the issue and attaching all evidence.
    *   File a claim through the Case Log in Seller Central under “Amazon FBA Reimbursement” or “My issue is not listed”.
4.  **Monitor and Follow Up:**
    *   Monitor the claim status in the Case Log.
    *   Respond promptly to Amazon’s requests for additional information.
    *   Verify reimbursements in the Reimbursements Report (appears 4–5 days after approval).
    *   Be persistent: Amazon may deny claims initially. Politely escalate the case if you have strong evidence. Reopen closed cases if new evidence arises.
    *   Dispute if necessary: If the claim is denied or the amount is incorrect, provide further evidence or contact the FBA Reimbursement Support team.

### Best Practices & Critical Considerations

*   **Time Limits:** Act fast! 18 months is often the absolute maximum deadline for initiating most claims, but shorter windows (e.g., 90 days for fee errors, 60 days for many claims effective October 23, 2024) are very common. Filing outside these windows is a common reason for denial.
*   **Document Everything:** Maintain meticulous records of shipments, inventory, communications, and reports.
*   **Know Amazon's Policies:** Understand the Seller Agreement, FBA policies, Returns policies, and Fee Schedules. Policy misunderstanding is a common reason for claim denial.
*   **Audit Regularly:** Audit your account at least once per month. Regularly monitor reports weekly. Proactive auditing is essential as Amazon’s automatic system may miss up to 40% of eligible claims.
*   **Use Tools Wisely:**
    *   **Amazon's Reports:** "Inventory Adjustments" report, "Manage FBA Shipments," "Returns," and "Reimbursements" reports.
    *   **Third-Party Auditing Tools:** Consider using reputable services like Helium 10 Refund Genie, Sellerboard, GETIDA, Seller Investigators, or KwickMetrics. These tools can scan reports automatically, identify discrepancies, and file claims on your behalf, often recovering more than manual efforts. They typically charge a commission only when you recover funds.
    *   **Avoid Automated Tools for Filing:** Amazon prohibits using automated tools to file claims, as this can lead to warnings or account suspension.
    *   **Track Diligently:** Use spreadsheets or reimbursement software to track claims filed, statuses, amounts, and deadlines.
*   **Account Health:** Maintain good Seller Account Health. Amazon is more likely to cooperate with sellers in good standing. A-to-Z claims can affect your account health; respond to customer inquiries within 48 hours to avoid automatic deductions.
*   **Be Professional:** Always communicate professionally and factually with Seller Support.
*   **Verify Reimbursement Amounts:** Compare Amazon’s reimbursement amounts to your expected values (based on median sale prices or manufacturing costs). Dispute discrepancies with supporting data.
*   **Tax Considerations:** Reimbursements are often paid without sales tax or VAT. Consult a tax advisor to ensure proper tax treatment, as reimbursements (e.g., for lost inventory) should be recorded as recovered income, not sales.
*   **Common Reasons for Claim Denials:** Insufficient documentation, missed deadlines, non-eligible items (not registered with FBA, defective, or damaged by customers), policy misunderstanding, and automated tool usage. To address denials, review Amazon’s feedback, provide additional evidence, or use third-party services like Sellerise to appeal with expertise.

By proactively monitoring your account, understanding these grounds for reimbursement, and diligently filing claims with strong evidence, you can recover significant lost revenue as an Amazon seller. Don't leave money on the table!
